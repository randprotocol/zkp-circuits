# Privacy

This is the "what does confidential actually mean here" document: what the
zero-knowledge property covers, what a tier reveals, exactly what a proof
leaks, and where the crate's privacy story stops today.

## Zero knowledge is statistical, not perfect

Proving uses `HidingFriPcs` (`machine.rs::build_config`), which randomises
the low-degree extension of every main trace and the FRI batch polynomial
before committing. `make_config` seeds this from fresh OS entropy for every
proof, so two proofs of the same run are different bytes and both verify —
demonstrated in Part 7 of the demo and in `tests/zk.rs`. This is not perfect
zero knowledge, and the crate does not claim it is: Plonky3 0.7 says so
itself, in `p3-batch-stark-0.7.0/src/prover.rs:469` — `// TODO: This
approach is only statistically ZK.` The gap is a fixed, quantifiable
soundness/privacy tradeoff of the library's blinding technique, not a bug in
this crate; closing it is upstream's work, not this milestone's. Poseidon2's
round constants are likewise derived from a fixed development seed
(`PERM_SEED` in `machine.rs`) rather than the published Goldilocks constants
— a placeholder for the same reason: correct math, wrong constants for
production.

`Machine::new` takes a `FriProfile`: `Production` (80 FRI queries, 20
proof-of-work bits — the whitepaper numbers) or `Test` (16 queries, 4 PoW
bits, for a fast `cargo test`). Both use blowup 8 and the same hiding PCS;
only the query count and grinding difficulty differ, which is why a
`Production` proof is roughly four times the bytes of a `Test` proof of the
same trace (Part 8 of the demo prints both) without either one being any
less zero-knowledge than the other.

## Private inputs are witness, not yet bound to anything

`READ_INPUT idx` (syscall 2) returns whatever word the prover supplies at
that index — a value chosen by the prover, checked by nothing. Nothing ties
two reads of the *same* index together either: the constraint system treats
each `READ_INPUT` row independently, so `READ_INPUT 0` may return one word on
one cycle and a different word on the next and the proof still verifies. The
input array is a per-row witness, not a committed vector; a guest that needs a
stable value must read it once and keep it in a register. Milestone 1's
relation is existential: it proves *"there exist inputs such that running
this program on them produced these outputs,"* full stop. Nothing here binds
a private input to a note commitment, a nullifier, or a Merkle path against
a public state root — that arrives with syscalls 10–13 (`POSEIDON2`,
`NOTE_COMMIT`, `NULLIFY`, `MERKLE_VERIFY`) in milestone 3. Until then, "the
balance is private" means only that the verifier never sees the number, not
that the number is tied to any real account.

The one exception is the shielded transfer guest, which binds its inputs by
recomputing note commitments and a nullifier in-circuit and publishing them
(`docs/06-viewing-keys.md`). That is a per-guest choice, not a machine
property: `READ_INPUT` itself is still unchecked, and the transfer's `cm_in`
is a *public* output checked by the ledger rather than a Merkle witness, so
the spent commitment — and with it the link from a note's creation to its
spend — is visible on chain until milestone 3.

## Selective disclosure: viewing keys

A shielded transaction is opaque to the chain and readable by exactly two
kinds of key: a party's viewing key (its whole history, sent and received)
and a per-transaction key (one transaction). Neither can spend. Every row a
key opens carries sender, receiver, amount, asset and time together with the
note opening, so a third party holding the same key checks the row against
the on-chain commitments and nullifiers rather than trusting whoever handed
it over. The construction, the checks, and the honest list of what it does
not yet cover are in `docs/06-viewing-keys.md`.

## `hc` is binding, not hiding — and the program is not secret in M1

`hc` is the preprocessed Merkle root, and `machine.rs::key_config` seeds its
salt from `program_digest`, a deterministic function of the program itself. A
commitment whose randomness is derived from the message it commits to is
**binding but not hiding**: anyone who can guess a candidate program can
recompute `hc` and confirm the guess, and two deployments of the same program
produce the same `hc` and are trivially linkable. The earlier framing — "no
privacy is lost because the program table is public" — was the wrong reason
for the right mechanism.

The right reason is simpler: **program confidentiality is not a milestone-1
property.** `Machine::verify(program, proof)` takes the entire `Program` in
the clear; every verifier holds every instruction word. There is nothing for a
salt to hide, so a deterministic non-hiding digest costs nothing here, and the
determinism buys something real — any verifier can recompute `hc` standalone
without having witnessed the proving session.

That changes in milestone 3, where the code digest moves in-circuit and the
verifier stops holding the program (`docs/05-roadmap.md`). That is the point
at which a *hiding* program commitment — a salt from real entropy, published
alongside the program's ciphertext, or a digest computed under the proof —
becomes both necessary and possible. Until then, treat `hc` as an identifier
for a public program, not as a secret-keeping commitment.

## What `verify` actually checks

`Machine::verify(program, proof)` — the code a node runs — checks, in order:
the proof carries exactly 10 public values; every one of them is a canonical
Goldilocks residue (`< p`, so `out0` and `out0 + p` are not two spellings of
the same proof); `public_values[PC_ENTRY]` equals `program.base_pc`; `public_values[TIER]` equals `proof.tier`; `proof.tier` is
one of the six values in `TIERS` (an attacker-chosen out-of-range tier is
rejected here, before it can be used to compute a table height and panic);
the proof's degree bits match the heights that tier implies for all five
tables; and finally the batch STARK itself, against a verifier key recomputed
from the program. Both `verify` and `code_hash` recompute that key from
scratch every time, including the full 2^16-row byte table's preprocessed
commitment — a known, fixed cost of this milestone, not yet cached.

## Tiers: what padding hides

Trace height never reflects the actual cycle count; it is padded up to the
smallest tier that fits. `cpu` and `alu` pad to `2^ℓ` and `2^(ℓ+1)` rows,
`memory` to `2^(ℓ+2)` (four accesses per cycle, worst case); `program` pads
to the next power of two above the program's own length (minimum 16 rows);
`byte` is always the fixed 65 536 rows. Padding rows carry `is_real = 0` and
emit nothing on any bus.

| Tier `ℓ` | `cpu` rows | `alu` rows | `memory` rows | max cycles |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | 1 024 | 2 048 | 4 096 | 1 023 |
| 12 | 4 096 | 8 192 | 16 384 | 4 095 |
| 14 | 16 384 | 32 768 | 65 536 | 16 383 |
| 16 | 65 536 | 131 072 | 262 144 | 65 535 |
| 18 | 262 144 | 524 288 | 1 048 576 | 262 143 |
| 20 | 1 048 576 | 2 097 152 | 4 194 304 | 1 048 575 |

A run that needs more than `tier.max_cycles()` cycles for its chosen tier is
refused by `build_traces`, not silently truncated.

## What a proof leaks

| Data | Status |
|---|---|
| The program itself | public — `verify` takes it in the clear; `hc` identifies it, it does not hide it |
| Code hash `hc` | public — the preprocessed commitment, binding but not hiding |
| Entry point `pc_entry` | public |
| Gas tier `ℓ` | public per proof (the proof's own size already reveals its trace height, so hiding the tier index buys nothing at the single-proof level; a batch-level histogram, as the whitepaper describes, is a property of the aggregation layer, not of one proof) |
| Eight output words | public |
| Private inputs (`READ_INPUT` values) | hidden — witness only |
| Every register and memory value | hidden |
| Every branch taken | hidden |
| The exact cycle count | hidden — only the padded tier height is visible |
| Which syscalls ran, beyond what the outputs imply | hidden |
| Shielded transfer (`guests::transfer`): the spent commitment `cm_in`, nullifier, created commitment, and time | public — `cm_in` only because membership is not yet proved in-circuit |
| Shielded transfer: sender, receiver, amount, asset, note randomness | hidden from the chain; opened by the receiver's or sender's viewing key, or by the transaction key (`docs/06-viewing-keys.md`) |

## The delegated-proving boundary

Proving is out of the circuit's scope by design: the witness is a
`Vec<CycleEvent>` (`emulator::Execution`), and whoever holds it — the
prover, wherever it runs — sees everything: every register, every branch,
every private input. The zero-knowledge property protects the verifier's
view of the proof, not the prover's view of the computation. A confidential
application that cannot trust its own prover needs a separate delegation
story (trusted hardware, MPC, or proving on the data owner's own machine);
this crate does not attempt to solve that, matching the whitepaper's own
remark on the boundary.
