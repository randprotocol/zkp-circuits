//! Notes, commitments, nullifiers, and the key hierarchy the `transfer` guest and the
//! viewing-key layer share. Everything here is a pure function of `arx::hash`, and every
//! function the guest recomputes in-circuit has its reference here.
//!
//! ```text
//!   sk  ──H_NK──▶  nk (= the viewing key)  ──H_PK──▶  pk (the address)
//!                    │
//!                    ├──H_NF(nk, rho)──▶  nf     (nullifier of the note with nonce rho)
//!                    ├──H_OVK────────▶  ovk    (wraps outgoing envelopes, `viewing.rs`)
//!                    └──H_KEM_SEED───▶  ML-KEM keypair (receives envelopes, `viewing.rs`)
//! ```
//!
//! The one-way arrows are what make "view without spend" true: `nk` is derived *from* `sk`,
//! so a holder of `nk` can compute every address, nullifier and decryption key of the party
//! but cannot satisfy the `transfer` guest, which takes `sk` as a private input and derives
//! `nk` itself (`guests::transfer`). Widths are development widths — one or two 32-bit
//! machine words per field (`docs/06-viewing-keys.md`).
