# `research` — the Rand reference zkVM

## What this is

`rand_zkvm` is the concrete form of the whitepaper's universal execution
relation `R_exec` ("Confidential Arbitrary Computation"): one constraint
system, one verifier, every program bound only by its code commitment `hc`.
It proves *"there exist private inputs and an execution trace such that
running program `hc` on them produced these public outputs"* — nothing more
specific about the program is ever a parameter of the verifier.

It sits above `circuits/zkp1`–`zkp6`, which are teaching demos for individual
proof-system ideas (Groth16 vs. STARK, shielded pools, ring signatures,
Merkle mixers), and below the eventual `fullnode/`: this crate is a
standalone library and demo today, and the node that does not yet exist is
meant to embed its verifier as consensus code (see "Reading order" below and
`docs/05-roadmap.md`). Everything else in the protocol that touches proofs —
the node's `zkp` module, the SVM precompiles, the EVM and Solana guest
story — is expected to converge on what this crate does, rather than each
growing its own proof system.

## Run it

```
cd research
cargo build --release   # first build takes a few minutes; Plonky3 is a large dependency tree
cargo run --release     # the narrated demo, ~5-6 minutes wall time (eleven proofs, one at production FRI parameters)
cargo test              # 43 tests: emulator, per-table constraints, cheating provers, zero knowledge, end-to-end
```

The toolchain is pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml` (1.98.1); `rustup` will pick
it up automatically. `cargo test` uses `FriProfile::Test` throughout (16
queries, 4 proof-of-work bits) so the suite runs in well under a minute per
proving test; the demo runs one full `FriProfile::Production` proof (80
queries, 20 PoW bits) to show the real numbers, and one `FriProfile::Test`
proof of the same trace so you can see the parameter effect directly.

## The machine in one picture

The relation is proved as one batch of five AIR tables under a single
commitment and a single FRI opening. Tables never call each other directly;
they exchange facts through eight named LogUp buses, and the batch verifier
checks that every bus balances globally.

`program` and `byte` are preprocessed (committed once, independent of any
witness); `cpu`, `memory`, and `alu` are main traces, rebuilt per execution.

## How confidential arbitrary computation works

Run `cargo run --release` alongside this section — it narrates exactly this.

A confidential call publishes three things: the code hash `hc`, the gas tier
(which bounds proof/verify cost and reveals itself through proof size
regardless), and a fixed-length array of output words. Everything else —
every register, every memory cell, every branch, the exact cycle count, and
every private input — stays inside the witness and is never seen by a
verifier (Part 1 of the demo). The *program* is not among the hidden things:
`verify` takes the whole `Program` in the clear, so `hc` identifies a public
program rather than hiding a secret one. Program confidentiality is not a
milestone-1 property (`docs/03-privacy.md`).

Private inputs enter through the `READ_INPUT idx` syscall: the prover
supplies whatever word it wants at that index, and the constraint system
only ever sees it flow through arithmetic and comparisons on the way to an
output (Part 2 builds `balance_check`, which sums four private balances and
outputs a single bit: is the sum over a threshold). Outputs leave through
`WRITE_OUTPUT slot word`, which is constrained directly against the proof's
public values — there is no other way for a value to become public. Nothing
in this milestone binds a `READ_INPUT` value to any commitment or account;
the relation proved is existential, not "this specific note was spent." See
`docs/03-privacy.md` for exactly why that matters and what closes the gap.

Execution happens natively and in the clear on the prover's machine (Part
3) — the emulator is the reference semantics, and nothing about running it
is itself confidential; confidentiality is a property of the *proof*, not
of the execution environment. Arithmetization (Part 4) turns that execution
into five tables padded to the smallest gas tier that fits, which is why the
trace height — and hence the tier — is the only thing about "how much work
happened" that a verifier can see. Proving and verifying (Part 5) run
against Plonky3's hiding FRI PCS, so the main-trace and quotient commitments
carry fresh randomness on every call: two proofs of the identical run are
different byte strings and both verify (Part 7), which is what makes the
zero-knowledge property real rather than aspirational — though it is
*statistical*, not perfect zero knowledge, because that is what Plonky3
0.7's hiding PCS provides (`docs/03-privacy.md` cites the library's own
comment saying so). Part 6 tries to cheat twice — claiming a wrong output,
and verifying a proof against a different program's `hc` — and both are
rejected, because both change something the constraint system or the
verifier key actually pins down.

Mapped onto the whitepaper's shielded-pool language: `R_transfer` (the
Zcash-style spend/output relation from `zkp4`/`zkp6`) is just another guest
program under this same `R_exec`, once notes, nullifiers, and Merkle paths
exist as syscalls. Those arrive as syscalls 10–13 (`POSEIDON2`,
`NOTE_COMMIT`, `NULLIFY`, `MERKLE_VERIFY`) in milestone 3 — see
`docs/05-roadmap.md`. Milestone 1 proves the general-purpose machine works;
milestone 3 is what turns it into a shielded pool.

## The three targets

Only RISC-V executes natively today. Solidity and Solana are software
running under the same relation, not separate circuits:

| Target | Path into `R_exec` | Coprocessor tables it will want |
|---|---|---|
| RISC-V | native | none |
| Solidity | `solc` → EVM bytecode → a `no_std` EVM interpreter compiled to RV32IM, bytecode as private input | Keccak-256, 256-bit `ADDMOD`/`MULMOD`/`EXP`, `ECRECOVER` (secp256k1), Merkle-witness syscalls for `SLOAD`/`SSTORE` |
| Solana / SVM | sBPF ELF → an sBPF interpreter compiled to RV32IM | SHA-256, Ed25519 verify, 64-bit multiply; a direct sBPF→RV32 translator is a natural later optimisation |

Publishing a contract under this model means registering a hash, never
generating a bespoke circuit. Details, cycle-cost estimates, and what
milestone 4 builds first: `docs/04-guests.md`.

## What leaks and what does not

| Data | Status |
|---|---|
| The program itself, its code hash `hc`, entry point `pc_entry`, gas tier, eight output words | public |
| Private inputs, every register/memory value, every branch, the exact cycle count, which syscalls ran | hidden |

`hc` is binding but not hiding — its salt is derived from the program — which
costs nothing while the verifier holds the program anyway.

Full detail, including the tier-to-row-count table and the delegated-proving
boundary: `docs/03-privacy.md`.

## Deviations from the whitepaper

1. `hc` is a verifier-side (per-program) commitment in this milestone, not
   yet a public value the universal verifier consumes — milestone 3 moves
   it in-circuit. It is also binding but not hiding, which is only acceptable
   because `verify` holds the program in the clear today.
2. The gas tier is public per proof, not only as a batch-level histogram.
3. Zero knowledge is statistical in Plonky3 0.7, not perfect.
4. The transcript hash is Poseidon2, not the whitepaper's SHA3-384/BLAKE3-384
   — a config swap, not a rewrite.
5. Recursion and per-batch aggregation are out of scope until milestone 4+.
6. Selector refinement: 18 pre-decoded semantic fields replace one flag per
   mnemonic (`docs/01-isa.md`) — same trust model, fewer columns.

## Reading order

1. `src/isa.rs` — the instruction set, encoding, and the 18-field selector
   set the program table commits.
2. `src/emulator.rs` — the reference semantics; if the AIR and this
   disagree, the AIR is wrong.
3. `src/tables/cpu.rs` — one row per cycle, fetch/decode-selectors/pc.
4. `src/tables/memory.rs` — registers and RAM in one sorted table.
5. `src/tables/alu.rs` — byte-limb arithmetic, shifts, compares.
6. `src/machine.rs` — the Plonky3 config, tiers, `prove`/`verify`.
