//! One `Proof`, flattened into the tape the program reads with `HINT` — in **consumption order**,
//! not `Proof::to_bytes`' postcard order, with a segment table a test pins.
//!
//! The plan's ruling: the two orders genuinely differ. `verify_fri` needs each round's `log_arity`
//! before it can derive `log_global_max_height` (and that lives postcard-late, inside
//! `commit_phase_openings`), and it needs the query indices before the input openings they index. A
//! one-pass tape in postcard order is therefore not expressible, so the whole mapping lives here,
//! in one host builder, with [`WitnessTape::build`]'s segment order pinned by
//! `tests/verifier.rs::the_witness_tape_layout_is_pinned`.
//!
//! Three segments are more than a flattening:
//!
//! - `QueryBits` needs the *sampled elements*, not the query indices — the program's `sample_bits`
//!   decomposes all sixty-four bits of the canonical representative and checks the decomposition is
//!   canonical, so the tape carries the bits and the inverse-or-zero hint. It therefore runs the
//!   same [`crate::reference::replay`] the tests compare against.
//! - `InputPaths` and `CommitPhasePaths` expand each round's *pruned* multiproof into one full
//!   authentication path per query, through `MerkleTreeMmcs::restore_and_recompute_paths` — which
//!   exists in Plonky3 0.7 for exactly this caller (`p3-merkle-tree-0.7.0/src/mmcs/mod.rs:899-913`)
//!   and does the same walk, so it costs the host no extra hashing.
