//! digest. The cs6 `H_PUB` pattern (`Machine::verify_public`): the words travel with the
//! transaction, the proof carries only their commitment.
//!
//! The list itself, its layout, and the recompute-and-compare flow are spec §4.4 unchanged; only

//! public-value vector at all, and tying a raw 39-word list to the trace costs ~78 columns).
