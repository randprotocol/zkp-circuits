//! The chain-facing aggregate API (spec §6, amended by M5.2's R5/R6 and M5.3's R6): `aggregate`
//! turns N same-shape RV32-machine proofs into one rVM proof whose four batch public values are
//! the interface digest of `[inner_vk_digest ‖ N ‖ B(8) ‖ 34·N]` — B the chain's
//! `H("rand-aggregate-bind-1", chain_id ‖ aggregator ‖ nonce)` (audit v3, AGG-2) — and
//! `verify_aggregate` checks the digest the node recomputes from the covered bundles before the
//! ordinary rVM `Machine::verify` — the cs6 `verify_public` pattern: the §4.4 list travels with
//! the transaction as auxiliary data, the proof carries only its commitment.
//!
//! The registered artifact is [`aggregate_program`]'s digest: one N-generic program per inner
//! shape, built once at startup and pinned (R6).
